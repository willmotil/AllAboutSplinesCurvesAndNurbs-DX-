# AllAboutSplinesCurvesAndNurbs-DX-
 Little testing class

 I have made example folders in the same order as the things i have worked on or tried.
 Ex 2 thru 4 are closed curve examples.
 Starting with example 5 weighted bezier curves.
 It starts to get a little more sophisticated as i have sort of made up my own little take on piecewise curvature.
 The game class for it has the option to use open or closed curves.

I was asked what they are called ... If there is a official name for it i don't know however.
The idea for this sort of curve is auto calculate the ideal tangent and plot new control points to it for each segment.
I sort of made it up inspired by multiple things i read or watched but it's probably been done before by someone.
So im just going to call em 'tangental piecewise beziers' unless someone has a better name for what this is.

Later on ill be adding mesh terrain creation examples with them in this project to show how to make surface geometry.
I may also work on some model mesh creation examples.
I may tackle different types of nurbs here eventually.

Ill probably work on a decent 3d camera class here that is actually the formost reason for this test project.
